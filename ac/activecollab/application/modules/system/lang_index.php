  198 => 'If you are having problems with getting activeCollab to send email messages, please review following notes',
  199 => 'Email notifications are sent to all subscribers in their prefered language. Exception is person who does the action - even if that person is subscribed, he or she will not get a notification about what they just did because he or she is already aware of it. If you wish to test how notifications are working, you\'ll need an additional user account',
  200 => 'Many SMTP servers do not allow relaying of messages (i.e., emails sent to the server from external locations) when the sending email address is not on the same domain as the SMTP server. In this case, make sure that From Notifications address is of the same domain as SMTP server',
