The following is a list of Ink.js extensions:

 * [ink-oembed](http://github.com/rogeriopvl/ink-oembed)
 * [inkmorse](https://github.com/celso/inkmorse)
 * [k(Ink)](https://github.com/entomb/k-ink-interface)

If you create an extension, please see [the docs](http://localhost:4000/javascript/Ink/#Ink_1-Ink_1-createExt) on how to put it in the designated namespace (Ink.Ext) and ping us so we can add it to this list :)
