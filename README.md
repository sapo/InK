## Note about this branch

The default branch of this repository is `develop`. This is a development branch, which is usable and has the latest features, but is not so stable as `master`, our release branch. Bugfixes are to be pushed to `develop`, where development takes place.

This branch contains built files in the `dist/` folder.


# Welcome to [Ink](http://ink.sapo.pt)

Ink is an interface kit for quick development of web interfaces, simple to use and expand on. It uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to offer modern solutions for building layouts, display common interface elements and implement interactive features that are content-centric and user friendly for both your audience and your designers & developers.

Read the full documentation here: [http://ink.sapo.pt](http://ink.sapo.pt). The Ink.js documentation is in [http://js.ink.sapo.pt/docs/](http://js.ink.sapo.pt/docs/) (note: this documentation is for the most recent release, but the development version may have additions).


## Current Version: 2.2.1

We've completely rewritten the grid system and JavaScript components, along with many other changes. Please read our [changelog](http://ink.sapo.pt/changelog) to find out about them.


## Repository branches
    
We have three branches on our github repository:

* The **[master](https://github.com/sapo/Ink/tree/master)** branch contains the latest release as its HEAD and all previous releases as tags.
* The **[develop](https://github.com/sapo/Ink/tree/develop)** branch contains our latest code that will eventually lead to a new release and tag on **[master](https://github.com/sapo/Ink/tree/master)**. This branch is likely to contain code that is not fully functional or documented. Use at your own risk.
* The **[staging](https://github.com/sapo/Ink/tree/staging)** branch is a semi-stable branch containing code from the develop branch which is going to go into the next release.

To get a specific release clone the repository and use, e.g. `git checkout 1.0.0`.


## Getting started

Let's get you started with Ink right away. Here's what you need to know and do:

1. Download latest build.
2. Open `my-page.html` if you want to serve Ink from your host or `my-cdn-page.html` if you want to serve Ink from our servers.
3. Check the template we provide and remove whatever you don't feel necessary for your project.
4. Make sure you have `ink.css`, `ink-ie.css` and `ink.js` included somewhere in the `<head>`.
5. Add your own stylesheets and scripts to carry all your project-specific changes.
6. Keep coming back to the documentation to help you along the way.
7. That's it! You'll see how easy it is once you pick it up.


# Installation instructions for hacking on Ink

Do this process if you'd like to build your own Ink and hack on the Ink source.

Make sure you have `node` installed. Then, on the root Ink folder of this repo:

    [sudo] npm install -g bower grunt-cli
    bower install
    npm install
    grunt


## JavaScript modules

The Ink JavaScript modules used to be in a separate repository. Now they are in the `src/js` folder. Check out the `README.md` file inside with further information regarding those modules.


## LESS Compiler

Ink requires the 1.4.2 LESS compiler version.
